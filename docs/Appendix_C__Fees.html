<h2>Appendix C – Withdrawal Fees and Merchant Fees</h2>

<h3>What Are Merchant Fees in RapidPay?</h3>
<p>A merchant fee is a charge applied when users spend in the system. The purpose of merchant fees in RapidPay is to encourage users to spend within time window to avoid a decay in spending value while providing income for RapidPay.</p>

<h3>What Are Withdrawal/Exit Fees in RapidPay?</h3>
<p>A withdrawal or exit fee is a small charge applied when users take money out of the system — either after missing the spend window (post-decay) or without spending at all.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> 75+% must be spent in order to avoid decay</p>

<h4>Purpose of Withdrawal/Exit Fees</h4>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prevents Late-Stage Deal Manipulation:</strong> Without a fee, users could top up, view all deals, cherry-pick none, and then withdraw without consequence.</li>
    <li><strong>Discourages Passive Holding:</strong> Keeps users from treating RapidPay like a savings wallet. Instead, it nudges engagement.</li>
</ol>

<h3>User Behavior Fee Table</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Spends 75%+ within 48 hours:</strong> ❌ No fee – Gets full value and rewards</li>
    <li><strong>Spends 75%+ within 48–96 hours:</strong> ✅ 5% Merchant fee – Decay after 2–4 days</li>
    <li><strong>Spends 75%+ within 96–144 hours:</strong> ✅ 8% Merchant fee – Decay after 4–6 days</li>
    <li><strong>Withdraws balance after 7 days unused:</strong> ✅ 10% fee</li>
    <li><strong>Withdraws within first 24h of top-up unused:</strong> ✅ 10% fee – Prevents “peek-and-leave” abuse</li>
    <li><strong>Withdrawn after receiving payment:</strong> ✅ 2% fee – General Withdrawal fee</li>
</ul>

<p><em>1% of fees, except withdrawal fees, go to companies to offset late payment losses.</em></p>
